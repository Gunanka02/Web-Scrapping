# Web-Scrapping
This project focuses on web scraping, a technique to automate data extraction from websites. We chose to scrape news data from the BBC News World section using Python to gather valuable information like headlines, categories, and timestamps. The idea is to convert unstructured web data into a structured format (CSV) for further analysis.
